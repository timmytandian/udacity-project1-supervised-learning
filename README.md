# Overview
This is a repository containing works for the first project to graduate from Udacity Nanodegree "Introduction to Machine Learning with TensorFlow" program in 2022. 

Based on a fictions tabular customer data, I built a model to predict whether a person makes more than $50,000 using supervised learning algorithm. So, this is a categorization problem. 

# Motivation
This repository is intended as a portfolio for datascience work. Recruiter/hiring managers can get idea about my skill and working style as well. Below are skills/key concepts that I practiced in this project:
- supervised algorithm
- datascience/machine learning workflow
- tabular dataset
- categorization problem
- pandas and scikit-learn python libraries

# About files in this repository
Below is the explanation of files used in this project.
1. **finding_donors.ipynb**: this is the main file I used to build a prediction model. The flow/structure of this file was prepared by Udacity team. I contributed to cells marked with "TODO:". Key activities that I did in this notebook:
    - Data exploration
    - Data cleansing
    - Model building with scikit-learn pipeline
    - Initial evaluation of the model and its tuning
    - Final evaluation of the model
    - Extracting feature importance
2. **finding_donors.html**: the content of this file is the same as `finding_donors.ipynb`. If you want to review the code without jupyter notebook, you can use internet browser to view this file.
3. **visuals.py**: a file prepared by Udacity team. This file contains python functions to help visualizing data. Mainly uses matplotlib library.
4. **census.csv**: customer demography dataset used in this project. Contains 14 columns with more than 45,000 rows.
